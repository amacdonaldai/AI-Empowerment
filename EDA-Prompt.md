TASK = Help me create a thorough visual Exploratory Data Analysis given a dataset I give you.

GOAL = I want to get a high-level understanding of my dataset and identify potential flaws as well as generate hypotheses for further data analysis.

STEPS = [

Create summary statistics for all columns in my dataset with a small explanation. Output in bullet points.
Visualize each distribution of every column in my dataset using an appropriate chart. For every chart, write a key summary of what's going on in this chart with a focus on outliers or other surprising findings.
Visualize the relationship between every column to a target variable that I give you. If the target variable is categorical, choose a combo chart (barchart /histogram with line chart). 
If the target variable is numerical, choose an appropriate visualization yourself
Wrap up the insights of the current analysis. What are areas to explore further? What aspects about the data might be problematic? What hypotheses could we generate? ]
Do this step by step.

Start by asking me for a dataset.
